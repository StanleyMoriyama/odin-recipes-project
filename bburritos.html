        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
                <li>1 medium onion, sliced</li>
                <li>1 bell pepper, sliced</li>
                <li>16 ounces ground chicken</li>
                <li>16 ounces ground hot breakfast sausage</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon pepper</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon paprika</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
                <li>6 large eggs</li>
                <li>12 slices of cheddar cheese</li>
                <li>12 8" tortillas</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>In a sauté pan over medium heat, add 1 tablespoon olive oil. Once hot, add sliced onion and bell pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until veggies are lightly browned and onions turn translucent - about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from pan and set aside.</li>
                <li>Add ground chicken and sausage to skillet. Season with salt, pepper, paprika, and garlic powder. Cook for 3-4 minutes before stirring to get a nice brown crust on the bottom side. Stir and continue cooking for 3-4 minutes, or until meat is cooked through.</li>
                <li>In a bowl, whisk eggs. In a fresh nonstick pan over medium heat, add 1 tablespoon of olive oil and whisked eggs. As eggs begin to set on the bottom, pull the eggs across the pan with a spatula. This will form egg curds in the pan. Continue pulling and folding the eggs until no liquid remains. Remove from heat and set aside to cool.</li>
                <li>Lay out 12 tortillas on top of 12 squares of foil. Lay one slice of cheese in the middle of each tortilla. Then, evenly distribute vegetables, meat, and eggs between the tortillas. Tightly wrap up each burrito and wrap in foil.</li>
                <li>Store burritos in a gallon size freezer bag until ready to thaw and reheat.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <h2>Reheating Instructions</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stovetop - Store burritos in a gallon size freezer bag until ready to thaw and reheat.</li>
                <li>Microwave - Thawed or frozen, wrap burrito in a damp paper towel and microwave for 1-2 minutes, or until heated through.</li>
                <li>Toaster oven/oven - Preheat to 350 degrees and bake for about 10 minutes for a thawed burrito, or 15 minutes for a frozen burrito. Check and add more time as needed to warm through.</li>
            </ul>
