                <li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>

                <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
                <li>90 g honey</li>
                <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
                <li>1 pinch onion powder, or to taste</li>
                <li>1 pinch garlic powder, or to taste</li>
                <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Cut the breasts in half horizontally to create 4 steaks in total. Sprinkle each side with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Place flour in a shallow dish. Coat chicken in flour and shake off excess.</li>
                <li>Melt most of the butter in a large skillet over high heat - hold back about 1 tsp for later.</li>
                <li>Place chicken in skillet and cook for 2 - 3 minutes until golden. Turn and cook the other side for 1 minute.</li>
                <li>Turn heat down slightly to medium high.</li>
                <li>Make a bit of room in the pan and add garlic and top with remaining dab of butter. Stir garlic briefly once butter melts.</li>
                <li>Add vinegar, soy sauce and honey. Stir / shake pan to combine. Bring sauce to simmer, then simmer for 1 minute or until slightly thickened.</li>
                <li>Turn chicken to coat in sauce. If the sauce gets too thick, add a touch of water and stir.</li>
                <li>Remove from stove immediately. Place chicken on plates and drizzle over remaining sauce.</li>
            </ol>
