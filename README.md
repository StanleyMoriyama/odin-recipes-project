# odin-recipes-project

Introduction
- What it is
- What I hope to takeaway on varying topics

This project contains an HTML recipe book.
While simple in nature, this project will serve as an aide in growth and development in my Web Dev journey. More specifically hwoever, this Recipe book project will help me to further internalize and understand the technical skills and the applicative and theoretical knowledge revolving around the Command Line Terminal (CLI) in Linux, use of Git and Github, and basic HTML use.

CLI 
- Navigating and manage files and directories via CLI.

Git/GitHub
- Familiarize myself with pushing commits and building effective commit messages. 

HTML
- Strengthen boilerplate recollection, syntax and nesting habits, elements and attributes, utilizing correct absolute/relative paths for links and images, use proper paragraph and heading tags.
